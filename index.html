            <h1>Welcome aboard my cybersecurity adventure!</h1>

            <p>I'm Matthew, a UK-based enthusiast embarking on an exciting journey into the world of digital security and IT. My fascination with technology sparked when I was introduced to Windows 95 on our family computer. Since then, I've spent countless hours exploring online forums and communities, discovering the intricate world of exploits and vulnerabilities that exist within our interconnected lives.</p>

            <p>This website serves as my digital logbook, documenting my adventures in:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hacking:</strong> I'm particularly drawn to social engineering combined with remote connections—there's nothing quite like the thrill of convincing a target to unknowingly execute a hack. I'm currently revisiting my hacking skills after a 10-year hiatus, with a focus on Hack The Box challenges and upcoming studies at the Open University.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in various cybersecurity domains. I find great value in watching YouTube videos such as NetworkChuck and IPPSEC and I spend a lot of time listening to podcasts such as Darknet Diaries and Security Now.</li>
                <li><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Outside of cybersecurity, I enjoy setting up Minecraft servers for my family and exploring other home server solutions for media and entertainment.</li>
                <li><strong>Growing:</strong> My goal is to become a skilled security assessor, helping individuals and organizations fortify their digital defenses. This website will be a testament to my progress as I develop my reporting and assessment skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Feel free to explore my write-ups, project showcases, and reflections on the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. Let's connect and learn together!</p>
