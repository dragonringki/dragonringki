            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My passion for technology began with my first encounter with Windows 95 on our family computer. Since then, I've been captivated by the intricacies of computer systems and the ever-evolving landscape of digital threats. I'm particularly interested in the art of social engineering and the power of human psychology in exploiting vulnerabilities.</p>
